# How to Upload Real 3D Models

Currently, the website uses **procedural 3D models** (generated by code) for the showcase. You can replace these with real `.glb` files at any time.

## Steps to Replace Models

1.  **Find or Create a GLB Model**:
    *   The model **MUST** be in `.glb` format (Binary glTF).
    *   Recommended sources: Sketchfab (check license), Kenney Assets, or export from Blender.
    *   Try to keep the file size under 5MB for fast loading.

2.  **Rename Your Files**:
    Rename your downloaded files to match the expected names:
    *   Quantum Computer -> `quantum.glb`
    *   DJI Drone -> `drone.glb`
    *   Raspberry Pi -> `rpi.glb`
    *   Humanoid Robot -> `robot.glb`

3.  **Upload to Public Folder**:
    *   Move these files into the `public/3D_models/` folder in your project.
    *   Path: `src/public/3D_models/` (or just `public/3D_models/` depending on your root).

4.  **Refresh**:
    *   Reload the website. The code is smart enough to detect if the file exists. If it loads successfully, it will show the real model. If it fails (or file is missing), it falls back to the procedural version.

## Troubleshooting
*   **Model looks black?** It might lack materials or lighting. The scene uses standard environment lighting.
*   **Model is too big/small?** You can adjust the `scale` property in `src/components/Scene3D.tsx`.
*   **Model is facing wrong way?** You might need to rotate it in a 3D editor like Blender before exporting, or we can add rotation code.
